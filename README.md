# KEEP - Kotlin Evolution and Enhancement Process

This repository holds proposals for the [Kotlin Programming Language](https://kotlinlang.org).

The proposals themselves are colloquially referred to as KEEPs. 

## Current KEEPs

| KEEP Title | Proposal | Discussion |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- |
| Coroutines | repo: [kotlin-coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-coroutines) | [Issues](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-coroutines/issues)
| Type aliases | [type-aliases.md](proposals/type-aliases.md) | [Issue #4](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/issues/4)
| Bound callable references | [bound-callable-references.md](proposals/bound-callable-references.md) | [Issue #5](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/issues/5)

## How to give feedback

Discussion of ongoing KEEPs is held under issues in this repo. Please find the correspondence in the table above.

Please don't create new issues unless really necessary, let's try to keep discussions in one place.

## How to propose

If you only have a vague feature idea, please share it in the [#language-proposals](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/messages/language-proposals/) channel in our public Slack (get invite [here](http://kotlinslackin.herokuapp.com/)), or in the [Forum's Language design category](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/c/language-design).

If a discussion in these media has lead to a detailed proposal, feel free to submit a pull request here. We appreciate your work, but can not guarantee that all proposals will be considered soon after submission.

## KEEP as a process

We are gradually switching the design of Kotlin to this open process, the details of KEEP will be refined as we go.
