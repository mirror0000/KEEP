# KEEP - Kotlin Evolution and Enhancement Process

This repository holds proposals for the [Kotlin Programming Language](https://kotlinlang.org).

The proposals themselves are colloquially referred to as KEEPs. 

## Current KEEPs

| KEEP | Proposal | Discussion |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- |
| **Type aliases** | [type-aliases.md](proposals/type-aliases.md) | [issue #4](https://github.com/JetBrains/KEEP/issues/4)

## How to give feedback

KEEPs under discussion exist as [Pull Requests](https://github.com/JetBrains/KEEP/pulls) to this repo. To discuss one of them, please comment on the corresponding Pull Request.

## How to propose

If you only have a vague feature idea, please share it in the [#language-proposals](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/messages/language-proposals/team/) channel in our public Slack (get invite [here](http://kotlinslackin.herokuapp.com/)), or in the [Forum's Language design category](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/c/language-design).

If a discussion in these media has lead to a detailed proposal, feel free to submit a PR here. We appreciate your work, but can not guarantee that all proposals will be considered soon after submission.

## KEEP as a process

We are gradually switching the design of Kotlin to this open process, the details of KEEP will be refined as we go.
