# KEEP - Kotlin Evolution and Enhancement Process

This repository holds proposals for the [Kotlin Programming Language](https://kotlinlang.org).

The proposals themselves are colloquially referred to as KEEPs. 

## Current KEEPs

Current KEEPs are listed in [issues](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/issues).

New KEEPs and additions to current KEEPs are submitted as [pull requests](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/pulls).

There are also some KEEPs having their own repository for specification and discussions:

| KEEP Title | Proposal | Discussion |
| ---- | -------- | ---------- |
| Coroutines | repo: [kotlin-coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-coroutines) | [Issues](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-coroutines/issues)

## How to give feedback

Discussion of ongoing KEEPs is held under their related issues.

Please don't create new issues unless really necessary, let's try to keep discussions in one place.

## How to propose

If you only have a vague feature idea, please share it in the [#language-proposals](https://kotlinlang.slack.com/messages/language-proposals/) channel in our public Slack (get invite [here](http://kotlinslackin.herokuapp.com/)), or in the [Forum's Language design category](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/c/language-design).

If a discussion in these media has lead to a detailed proposal, feel free to submit a pull request here. We appreciate your work, but can not guarantee that all proposals will be considered soon after submission.

## KEEP as a process

We are gradually switching the design of Kotlin to this open process, the details of KEEP will be refined as we go.
