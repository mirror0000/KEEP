# Decommission `Enum.values()` and replace it with `Enum.entries`

* **Type**: Design proposal
* **Author**: Vsevolod Tolstopytov
* **Status**: Accepted
* **Prototype**: Implemented
* **Discussion**: [KEEP-283](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/issues/283)
* **Related issues**: [KT-48872](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-48872)

This proposal describes a rationale and a path to migrate from function `values()` provided by each enum type to a collection-based and more predictable abstraction.

## Motivation

Every Java and Kotlin enum type provides a [`values`](https://kotlinlang.org/spec/declarations.html#enum-class-declaration) method
that returns an array of all enum entries. 

Arrays are mutable by default, meaning that each call to `values()` always has to allocate a new instance of the array.
The API shape does not indicate that fact, often [leading](#examples-of-performance-issues) to hidden performance bugs in both Kotlin and Java.
It is hard for library authors to determine whether an arbitrary call to `values()` may lead to a performance bottleneck as
the profile depends on the "hotness" of the method, not on the enum's characteristics, effectively forcing authors to apply
a workaround or leave it as a potential performance issue.

Apart from that, most of the API being written leverages Collections API, not arrays, forcing users to manually convert arrays to lists.

## Proposal

The proposal that addresses all of the above is as follows:

* Decommission of `Enum.values()` with the IDE assistance without deprecation.
* Introduce property `entries: EnumEntries<E>` that returns an unmodifiable list of all enum entries.
* For already compiled Kotlin enums and Java enums, a special mapping class that contains a pre-allocated list of entries is generated. 

### Decommission of `Enum.values()`

Enums have been existing since the very beginning of Kotlin, and since Java 1.5, released in 2004, meaning that the deprecation
of `values` using Kotlin's standard [deprecation cycle](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-evolution.html#incompatible-changes) 
will create unnecessary disturbance in the ecosystem and will render a lot of already existing educational materials outdated.

To avoid that, `values()` will be softly decommissioned via IDE assistance:

* `values` will be de-prioritized and eventually removed from IDE auto-completion.
* Soft warning with an intention to replace call to `values()` with call to `entries` will be introduced.
* All the corresponding materials, such as Kotlin guides, J2K and tutorials will be adjusted to use `entries` API.
* Eventually, we are going to re-visit this decision and decide on the further deprecation of `values` API.

### `EnumEntries<E>` type

Effectively, `entries` represents an immutable list of enum entries and can be represented as type `List<E>`.
To have an ability to further extend Enum's API in a non-intrusive manner that does not involve code-generation
for each enum, we expose a direct subtype of `List<E>` named `EnumEntries`:

```
sealed interface EnumEntries<E : Enum<E>> : List<E>
```

We deliberately limit any extensions of this type to the standard library to have a future-proof way to 
extend it in the future in a backwards-compatible manner.
All future potential extensions, such as `valueOfOrNull(String)`, `hasValue(String)` can be implemented on the standard library
level as members or extensions of `EnumEntries`.


### Naming alternatives

Various languages use different notations to refer to enumeration elements, making the naming choice especially hard. 

We have considered the following alternatives:

* `values` property. While being the most familiar one, it carries the burdens of the existing `values()` API:
  * It is easy to misspel it with `values()` and fall into the same trap.
  * Introduction of `values` property adds an unfixable method reference ambiguity for all the callers of `E::values`.
* Java language [refers](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.9.1) to enum elements as `constants`. 
  * The risks of introducing widely-used API named `constants` with the potential clashes with [Kotlin constant evaluation](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-14652) outweighs the benefits of the straightforward name.
* `valuesList` and `entryList` suffer the same disease -- excessive verbosity of the name.
* `components` is already reserved in Kotlin for positional deconstructors.
* Kotlin specification and documentation already refer to enum elements as entries, making it our final choice.

### Translation strategy for Kotlin enums

For source-compiled enums, a new static property with a JVM signature `public static EnumEntries<E> getEntries()` is added,
returning a pre-allocated immutable list of enum entries.

For the sake of compatibility with bytecode pre-processors and reflection usages that modify a backing array `$VALUES` field,
the generated bytecode for `values()` is left intact, and the resulting list of entries reads the underlying `$VALUES` lazily,
leaving the chance for existing bytecode preprocessors to change the array without dealing with list allocation.

#### Implementation note

A special type, `EnumEntriesList` is introduced to the standard library. The type has the only constructor
accepting the functional type with a signature `() -> Array<E>`. The corresponding lambda is generated
using the standard `invokedynamic` with `LambdaMetafactory`.

The final decompiled class for the enum
```kotlin
enum class MyEnum {
    A;
}
```

has the following form (all irrelevant parts omitted):
```java
enum MyEnum extends Enum<MyEnum> {
    private static final synthetic MyEnum[] $VALUES
    private static final synthetic EnumEntries<MyEnum> $ENTRIES;
   
    <clinit> {
        A = new MyEnum("A", 0);
        $VALUES = $values();
        Supplier<MyEnum[]> supplier = #invokedynamic ..args.. $entries;
        $ENTRIES = EnumEntries.Kt.enumEntries(supplier); // internal factory from standard library
    }

    public static MyEnum[] values() {
        return $VALUES.clone();
    }
  
    public static EnumEntries<MyEnum> getEntries() {
        return $ENTRIES;
    }

    private synthetic static MyEnum[] $entries() {
        return $VALUES;
    }

    private synthetic static MyEnum[] $values() {
        return new MyEnum[] { A };
    }
}
```

### Translation strategy for compiled Kotlin enums and Java enums

For already compiled Kotlin enums and Java enums, a separate synthetic mapping classfile will be introduced 
for each callsite of `Enum.entries`. The mapping class acts as a storage for a lazily-initialized and pre-allocated list of
enum entries.

## Risks and assumptions

The proposal has two main risks:

The first is the potential source-compatibility issue for `entries` property in the companion object within an Enum.
After the implementation of the proposed change as is, the following existing code will change its behaviour:

```kotlin
enum class MyEnum {
    A;
    
    companion object {
        val entries: Any? = ...
    }
}

MyEnum.entries // <- member has a higher priority than a companion member
```

To mitigate that, a separate compiler-assistant deprecation cycle is introduced, that will keep companion's `entries`
priority higher than auto-generated memeber for the duration of the deprecation cycle.
Taking into account the additional deprecation cycle and non-trivial setup for the problem to reproduce, we do not 
consider it a serious threat to compatibility.

The second risk is the education disturbance and a new name for developers to get familiar with â€” `entries`, opposed to already well-known `values`.
It is mitigated by indefinitely long [soft decommision](#decommission-of-enumvalues) instead of a regular deprecation cycle.

## Collateral changes

In addition to an existing [`enumValues`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/enum-values.html) function in the standard library,
`enumEntries` function that returns `entries` list is added.
`enumValues` is deprecated for the removal.

## Timeline

The feature is going to be available as experimental starting from Kotlin 1.8.0 and as stable starting from Kotlin 1.9.0.
The corresponding language feature can be enabled with the `-XXLanguage:+EnumEntries` compiler argument in Kotlin 1.8.0.
